# Mini

This is a compiler project which I used to play with (and study) language features. Basically Mini is a functional programming language and the final goal is a type system similar to system F-omega with objects.

The syntax and implementation may change a lot between different versions, though I would try to make it compatible.

Project roadmap: [here](doc/features.md)

Documentation: [here](doc/language.md)

Install: With VS2019: Run [src/make.bat](src/make.bat), [src/make-test.bat](src/make-test.bat) (for tests). For other versions, modify the VS path in the two files.

Requires C++17.
